# .pre-commit-config.yaml
#
# This file configures pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality and consistency
# before changes are committed to the Git repository.
#
# To install these hooks in your local Git repository:
# 1. Make sure you have 'pre-commit' installed: pip install pre-commit
# 2. Navigate to your project root and run: pre-commit install
# 3. To run hooks on all files (useful for initial setup): pre-commit run --all-files
